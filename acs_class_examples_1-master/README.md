###How To Use
1. Create New Project and make sure you cloud-enable the application
1. Download the starter template from the github repo [https://github.com/aaronksaunders/acs-adapter-starter/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/aaronksaunders/acs-adapter-starter/archive/master.zip)
1. Copy the contents of the app directory from the starter-template to replace  the files in the new project you just created
1. Login to the appcelerator cloud service console - my.appcelerator.com
1. create a new test user for the application

After following those steps, you should be able to login the user you added in the console or create a new user using the application interface
